<i> Dear Love, </i>
</h2>

<p>
This is the first one that I am writing to you and right off the bat, I just wanna apologize for the slew of letters that you are about to read because I am not good at writing letters. I am not good at expressing myself, especially emotionally. But, I would like to try, if you would allow me, my love.

  Nuzhat Khan, I met you at a point in my life when I didn't really think I would want to love anyone again. I had just broken up with someone, which you already know about and I wasn't expecting someone to walk in through the door, walk up to me, put them hand on my chest, and revive my heart in the way that you did. You. You, my love. You are undoubtedly the best thing that has ever happened to me. The day you walked in the door and my eyes fell on you, I knew then in my heart, deep down, that I would not be the same ever again. I don't suppose you were trying to do what you did. I don't suppose you were intentionally doing what you were doing to me. I couldn't focus on anything but you, your beauty. I honestly cannot forget the first day. You wore a grey top and you had your hair tucked behind your left ear and you looked so excruciatingly beautiful. Excruciating, why, you ask? Because you were a little too beautiful that day. My eyes had never seen anyone so simple and so beautiful. You honestly took my heart away, that very day. I still remember when I had stolen very brief, very brief, glances towards you. I couldn't not notice such a beautiful human being around me. I honestly would've become a creep to you, if it were not for you, who later talked to me. I had my heart set on you, since that very day. I didn't know what was happening to me, I wasn't ready emotionally to love someone again but I was glad and I was happy that it was happening. I wanted to hug you, I've told you this before. I wanted to hug you so tightly that day. I just wanted to hug you, for so long. I wanted to hold you against my chest and caress your head and I wanted to breathe. I wanted to breathe in your presence and your existence. I wanted to thank you. I wanted to thank you, firstly, for existing. Secondly, for comming to Jamia. Thirdly, for choosing the same course as me. Fourthly, for finally finding me. I was lost, I was so lost. I would've lost myself even more if it were not for you. You found me. You saved me. You brought me back to life. You. You, without even knowing what you were doing. We often talk about the first week and the first month, but I genuinely was on cloud nine then. Sure, a part of me was also drowning in sorrow for whatever had happened before. But a greater part of me was just climbing all the stairs of the castle within me and that part of me went to the top of every tower and just shouted, as loudly as possible. It shouted that it, or me, Yusuf has finally been saved. This person who he doesn't even know has come to his life, friend or lover, he is going to be saved. I knew you were it. You had become it the very first day. I don't know how to describe that feeling again. I geuninely don't. I have never considered myself good enough, looks or otherwise, but I was glad I could see you, and talk to you, and be someone in your life, just anyone. I was and still am proud to be a part of your life. That is how important you were and have become for me.

At exactly 02:48:11 PM on 8th August, 2019, I knew that I was finally going to be happy, as long as you were with me. Your first ever text to me, "Such a cute picture. üòÇ‚ô•Ô∏è", has always been a very cherished moment for me. I could never thank you enough. I can never find words to thank you and appreciate you enough. I am and will always be grateful for you. Thank you, Nuzhat Khan, for being a part of my life and letting me be a part of yours. Thank you for being who you are. Thank you for having a good and honest heart. Thank you for having a beautiful soul. Thank you for being simple and yet so beautiful. Thank you for your smiles. Thank you for your laughters. Thank you for your cries. Thank you for letting me be a part of your first cry in college. Thank you for letting me be your safe space. Thank you for letting me give you my heart. It has been tossed and uncared for, for too long and then you came along and you cared for it like no one else ever did. You held it within your palms and you showered it with so much love that it started to beat properly again. My heart belongs to you. My soul belongs to you. My love belongs to you. My body belongs to you. I am yours. You are mine. Thank you.

<p>  
Yours lovingly,
  </p>
<p> 
Yusuf
