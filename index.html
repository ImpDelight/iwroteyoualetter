<h2>
<i> Dear Love, </i>
</h2>

<p>
This is the first one that I am writing to you and right off the bat, I just wanna apologize for the slew of letters that you are about to read because I am not good at writing letters. I am not good at expressing myself, especially emotionally. But, I would like to try, if you would allow me, my love.
